# Mulimedia-Search
# Authors: Stephanie Stelzer and Sara Osmanovic
# Problem: 
We want to help people find appropriate entertainment based on what they are in the mood to watch, read, or listen to.
# Motivation: 
This is a problem because of the information overload and over-saturation of our current digital climate. Making choices about how to spend and enjoy our free time has become overwhelming. Our program aims to help lower decision fatigue.
# Features: 
When implemented correctly, our program will work within filters to bring the user different options based on their inputted preferences. 
Ex: user wants to watch a movie; only movie options will be shown, not books, audio books, or any other forms of media.
Media Categories: Books/AudioBooks, Movies, Podcasts
