# April 14th
The data is mainly done. Each media category has its own separate file of just genres that appear. I filtered them so they don't duplicate, and picked the most relevant ones if there are too many. Books had over 800 different genres/categories so I picked around 150 most relevant ones. This list can be filtered again for implementation in UI, if 150 is too many categories to pick from.
# Notes about using the files
For coding and implementation, use .txt files. They are tab delimited and none of the strings in the cells have tabs or line breaks. That was the only way to ensure proper reading of cells when reading long strings like description and overview.
# Notes on books
Books have a string that contains the link to the cover image of the book. I kept it in the files just in case it proves useful in UI building.
